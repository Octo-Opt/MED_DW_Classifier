Model
    DeepWalk: word reprensentation. 
        => Create of graph by constructing adjacency matrix: assuming  
    Model: 
        + Basic Machine learning. 
        + Basic MLP.
        + Data Augmentation using DeepWalk

# ===== Step ===== 
1. Run vanilla:
    + Input Embedding with Word2Vec, implementing GNN. 
    + Random Walk: 
        + Naive. 
        + Bias. 
        
2. Run improvement by augment data: 
    + A word will be replaced a word with high similarity. 
    + Pick random word in a sentence to audment. 
    + Choosing from top_k, then: 
        + Replace chosen word by picking randomly from tok_k. 
        + Generate augmented samples.
